## Description
Text Quest is a text based game that will teach kids about the very basics of coding.

## Features
### Feature 1
A pop up window where the game will be displayed. I'll need a game loop, event loop, render, display, and update logic.
### Feature 2
Visual aides displayed in the pop up window.  I'll need to put all my visual aides in the source folder and I'll need to use blit to display my images.
### Feature N 
Interactive question and answer based gameplay. I'll need print functions and nested functions to account for correct and incorrect answers.

## Challenges
I'll have to go back to the basics and decide excactly what basics the game will include.
I'll have to review my notes to remind myself how to input all of the features I want.
I'll have to come up with a way to handle typos.

## Outcomes
Ideal Outcome:
A completetly finished game with visual aides and a pop up window.

Minimal Viable Outcome:
Question and answer based gameplay in the terminal.

## Milestones

- Week 1
  1. Research and plan the scope of my game
  2. Create visual aides

- Week 2
  1. Implement all question and answer based "lessons"
  2. Implement pop up window

- Week N (Final)
  1. Implement all visual aides
  2. Implement typo recovery
  3. Debug
