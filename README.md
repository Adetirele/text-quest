## Description
What it is: Text Quest is a short, educational game that teaches middle schoolers the basics of coding! It's very loosely based off of educational games I played as a kid, like I Station and RM City. 

What the files do: The image files serve as backgrounds for the game. I added a little character, Sir Pythonious III, to make the game more engaging towards it's demographic. The text file is a font I imported from FontSpace because I liked how it looked "medieval" while still being legible. I aligned all of my text to the left of the screen so that it wouldn't overlap with Sir P3. I also made the "right" and "wrong" outputs different colors so that the kids wouldn't get bored staring at walls of black text on a white background.   

Areas of improvement: I could add some color or sound effects to the game to make it feel more like a game. I could also make Sir Pythonious III look sad when the kids got an answer wrong or look happy when they got an answer right. I think adding animations of those things (like him thrusting his lance in the air and saying "Huzzah!" after a correct input or him taking a knee and his feather drooping after an incorrect input) would make the game more enjoyable for the young demographic. I also think that the font could be different, to increase legibility.

Design considerations: I purposefully made Text Quest 800 by 600 pixels because one of the games it was based off of, RM City, wouldn't take up the entire screen whenever it was launched. I couldn't find the exact dimensions of the window it was in, so I just chose 800 by 600. I think bolding and increasing the kerning of the letters would help with readability. I thought that it looked fine, but my dad (who is farsighted, but refuses to wear his glasses for some reason) momentarily struggled through a couple of words words when I was showing him the game.
